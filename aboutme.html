                        <img src="https://imgur.com/5lC3IF3.jpg" class="profileimg">Hello! My name is Dirk Richard Soughan
                    and I go to Perry Meridian High School. I participate in many honors courses, but I 
                    also know my limits. As a junior I plan on taking 3 AP classes as well as Two Music 
                    classes. As per extracurriculars, I have participated in multiple plays as Sound technician and
                    plan on entering my second season with the Perry Meridian Palcons Lacrosse Club. I love board games(as indicated
                    by some of the pictures) including Funkoverse, Umatched, and Dice Throne. I also am a big fan of LEGOs as 
                    well as motorcycles. Personally, I want a Harley, but I like any bikes. Otherwise, my free time is spent 
                    on YouTube and on video games such as Battlefront, Minecraft Dungeons, BrawlStars, and Clash Royale. I have
                    invested a lot of time into Computer Science with Intro to Computer Science, Computer Science 1, Nextech Catapult
                     Internship and coming up AP Computer Science. Design has been my favorite part, but I am ready to devote time
                    in many different areas as necessary. With design I especially enjoy the color and layout of a piece. In this 
                    case, my design for this portfolio is handdrawn, original work. I consistently create my own content throughout
                    the page as to show my ideas and who I am. I also enjoyed learning to space out my images such as my Contact Me
                    page as well as this page itself. I am Dirk Soughan, a High Schooler committed to design and increasing his Computer
                    Science skills no matter where my job takes me.
